Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router project

## Changes Made:

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
- Used npm (detected from package-lock.json) to install the package
- Command: `npm install @vercel/analytics`
- Package successfully added to dependencies in package.json

### 2. Updated Root Layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>` component
- This ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages in the app

### 3. Verification & Testing
- ✅ TypeScript type checking: Completed (pre-existing test file errors not related to our changes)
- ✅ ESLint: No linting errors introduced
- ✅ Build: Successfully compiled production build
- ✅ Tests: All 160 tests passed (20 test files)
- ✅ Lock file: package-lock.json updated with new dependency

## Files Modified:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

## Implementation Notes:
The project uses Next.js App Router (detected from app/layout.tsx structure).
The Analytics component was placed after the children to follow best practices and ensure proper tracking without interfering with the application's rendering flow.
All existing code structure and styling was preserved.
