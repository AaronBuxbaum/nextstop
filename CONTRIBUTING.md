# Contributing to nextstop

Thank you for your interest in contributing to nextstop! This project demonstrates Anthropic's best practices for building AI-assisted applications with distinctive frontend design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nextstop.git
cd nextstop
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd app
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

npm run dev
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use semantic HTML and ensure accessibility
- Test your changes before committing
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Frontend Design Principles

This project follows Anthropic's frontend-design skill principles:

- **Bold Typography**: Use distinctive font combinations
- **Intentional Color**: Cohesive palettes with CSS variables
- **Creative Motion**: High-impact CSS animations
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts and asymmetry
- **Visual Details**: Atmospheric backgrounds and textures

**Avoid**:
- Generic system fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter design patterns

### Code Style

- Use ESLint for code quality
- Format code consistently
- Add TypeScript types for all functions
- Write accessible HTML (ARIA labels, semantic elements)
- Optimize performance (lazy loading, code splitting)
